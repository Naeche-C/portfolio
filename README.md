# Portfolio Website ‚Äì Naeche Chukwuemeka

This is my personal portfolio site built as part of the HTML5 & CSS3 assignment.  
It demonstrates semantic HTML, responsive CSS without frameworks, accessibility best practices, and GitHub Pages deployment.


## üåê Website Structure

The portfolio contains **four main pages**:

1. **Home (`index.html`)**
   - Introduces me and provides a hero section with a short welcome.
   - Includes a call-to-action button linking to the About page.

2. **About (`about.html`)**
   - Contains my photo and a short **introduction video** (45‚Äì60 seconds).
   - Video uses a `poster` image and HTML5 `<video>` with `<source>` fallback and accessibility attributes.

3. **Projects (`project.html`)**
   - Showcases 4‚Äì5 projects with headings and short descriptions.
   - Includes responsive project ‚Äúcards‚Äù styled consistently across viewports.

4. **Contact (`contact.html`)**
   - Provides a contact form with **HTML5 validation**:
     - `required` fields
     - `type="email"` for email
     - `type="tel"` with pattern for phone number
   - Includes a footer with my email and copyright notice.

  - Implemented using **fluid layouts** and **separate CSS files per viewport** (no Flexbox/Grid).
  - Layout adjusts across mobile, tablet, and laptop viewports.
